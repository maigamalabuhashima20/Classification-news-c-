huge crowds and generate massive amounts of revenue.

Soccer is more than just a sport, however. It is a cultural phenomenon that has the power to bring people together and inspire passion and
pride. The game has the ability to unite nations and inspire hope, as demonstrated by the "Miracle of Bern," where West Germany defeated
Hungary in the 1954 World Cup Final.
