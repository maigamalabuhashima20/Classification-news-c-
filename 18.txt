Most of the sciences that man has known since ancient times until the present time are concerned with reaching solutions or explanations that clarify issues or address specific problems. The importance of the economy and its main topic, which was keen to study these relationships, which turned into an economic problem with the passage of time; due to the endlessness of human needs with the lack or scarcity of the means or resources related to them. [1] Economics is the study of scarce resources and their role in fulfilling needs, and economics is defined as the search for the appropriate way or method to benefit from and exploit resources, according to the pattern that suits societies and their needs. Economics is keen to find the best suitable alternatives to address scarce resources, seeks to explain economic phenomena, and anticipate events affecting the future of the economy.[1] , and preparing a set of future expectations based on the data of each economic theory, and the divergence of opinions of economic thinkers led to the emergence of agreement and clear disagreement between them about the various economic theories, [1] and the following is information about economic theories according to the opinions and ideas of the most important scholars and thinkers of the economy: Adam Smith’s theory was adopted Adam Smith in his study of the science of economics on the philosophy that was concerned with the study of human societies, and Smith was able to reach a theoretical conclusion Re indicates that people act based on their own interests; Therefore, they have the ability to produce services and products that are important to them as a single society. that is, in the form of one group, and he called this intellectual conclusion the name of the hidden hand, and Smith explained this theory by presenting examples about various industries and professions. From bread, and this is how all other industries operate, and these ideas were later known as the market economy system.[2] Karl Marx’s theory differed from Adam Smith’s theory, as Marx saw that the capitalist ideas expressed by Smith were unstable, and that the profits achieved by production Factories result from their exploitation of workers, so he pointed to the existence of a class struggle resulting from capitalism, and Karl Marx expected the collapse of capitalism and the interest of societies in communist socialism, which represents his economic thought; that is, workers owning the means of production, and Marx’s ideas were known as the socialist economy, but Marx’s intellectual theories did not succeed; As a result of two reasons: [2] The socialist economy was inefficient in the field of product production. With the passage of time, the rate of income of workers has increased; This contradicts Marx's theory of factories exploiting their workers in order to make profits. John Keynes's theory The scientist and economic thinker John Keynes cared about pursuing Smith's capitalist theory and ideas, and was able to deduce a set of theories that did not agree with Marx's views; Where Keynes was interested in studying the impact of governments on capitalism, and during the period of Keynes's study, the impact of the Great Depression on the economy was clear, and he saw that the only way out of this situation is for governments to seek cooperation with the private sector; by providing him with the money necessary to support the demand for services and goods, and with the passage of time Keynes' ideas turned into an economic system known as Keynesian economics.[2] prevalent in every human society; Which led to the development of the history of the economy in the lives of peoples, and here comes information about some of the most important economic systems: [3] The primitive communal system: it is the first economic system to appear in human history; Where man relied on primitive tools in production, and work and professional experiences were limited, so people relied on working in groups to adapt to nature, and they lived together within tribes dependent on traditions, and production was distributed equally among individuals. The slavery system: It is also known as the slavery system, and it appeared after the primitive communal system, and relied on the exploitation of individuals for each other, and the emergence of class differences, so work became limited to individual slaves; This led to the emergence of the term slave society, which was divided into two categories, namely, slaves and masters. The feudal system: It is the system that replaced the system of slavery, and depends on the existence of property and production tools that represent lands in the hands of individual feudal lords who exploit individual peasants. The feudal system includes the spread of feudal property in the lands of villages and cities; This reinforces the feudal lords' exploitation of the population living on these lands. The capitalist system: It is a modern economic system compared to the two previous systems, and it is concerned with making profits and promoting trade exchange. The means and tools of production are owned by a certain group of individuals called capitalists. As for the individuals who make up the large segment of society, they are the workforce that works in the private means of production. with the capitalists. The socialist system: It is the economic system that relies on the community's ownership of all productive means and tools. that is, promoting the existence of collective ownership, and this economic system seeks to provide all the needs of individuals, but it leads to a noticeable discrepancy between wealth and the average individual income; As a result of the variation in the quality and volume of work. Economic development Economic development is one of the most important factors and elements affecting the economy
